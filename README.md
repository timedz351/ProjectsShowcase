A small game I crunched in about 24 hours within the Game Design I course.
It's a decision based psychological visual novel.

# KHERTSCHMAH
A game prototype I've made as a project for Game Design II course.

### About
Game is inspired by Over Cooked, but this one is in first-person and situated in eastern Europe.
The current state of the project is a functional game prototype with 3 fast paced levels I plan to continue working on.

### Technical
Base of the code architecture was made following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg) CodeMonkey's course thanks to which I refreshed my C# knowledge of events, singleton pattern, OOP... and mostly got much better in Unity.

### About
Semestral project within the PV160: Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory.

Idea found and supervised by Ing. MatÄ›j Lang.

### Goal
Raise the ground for VR teleport

_VR teleportation uses a ray to point to a position we want to teleport to. What if, instead of curving the pointing line, we would curve the world?_

### Task
Implement and alternative teleportation system in VR that curves the landscape upwards with every start of the teleportation sequence to select a destination.
